## Virtual and Embodied Agents

Virtual agents, embodied in robots
are often large software systems with numerous modules.

* How to put them together right?
* How to take advantage ROS or my current middleware?
* How to deal with concurrent events and multi-threading?
* Which APIs to provide to the clients?
* How to implement the higher-level decision-making?

I had the opportunity to work on these issues in the past,
and I love to get into these challenges,
while taking care of the legacy.

## Decision-making, dialogues and AI

Interesting behaviors and dialogues can be achieved with classical programming,
with models like Behavior Trees, State Machines...

But there is a lot to gain by bringing in AI techniques:

* Custom language models and semantic extraction
* Planning to produce more flexible behaviors or dialogues
* Situational pattern recognition

I favor explainable solutions that let you in control,
and the reduction of data collection.

## Embedded Development

From MCUs to Android phones,
there is a large range of devices I can work with.
This is thanks to languages such as C++ or Rust.

I have experience in integrating native libraries with Python or Java,
and I am autonomous in developing the apps embedding them.

Did you know native libraries can be integrated in web apps too, thanks to WebAssembly?
